				<h1>Coding Standards</h1>
        <p>This is a guide to the specifications and formatting standards used in our front-end code, which involves a CSS cascade and a consistent HTML framework used across many of our pages. Our standards help us write code that is super-accessible and as easily maintainable as possible, so if you're committing code, please make sure it follows these standards.
				</p>
				<h2>XHTML Specifications</h2>
				<p>All of our pages are written in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML 1.0</a> (Strict), which is a cleaner, stricter version of HTML that separates content from presentation. Our pages use <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;</code> as their DOCTYPE declaration.
				</p>
				<p>Writing in XHTML 1.0 (Strict) means:
				  <ul>
				    <li>All markup must be written in lowercase</li>
				    <li>All tags must be closed
				      <ul>
				        <li>Empty tags are closed within the tag: <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code></li>
				        <li>Non-empty tags have a corresponding closing tag: <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
				      </ul>
				    <li>All tags must be properly nested</li>
				    </li>
				    <li>No <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/htmltags/a/bltags_deprctag.htm">deprecated elements</a> are included</li>
				  </ul>
				</p>
				<p>While our use of the ARIA <code>role</code> attribute means our pages will not validate, we still recommend checking your work with <a href="http://validator.w3.org">the W3C Markup Validation Service</a>.
				</p>
					<h3>Content-Type/Charset</h3>
					<p>The archive uses the UTF-8 character set: <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8"/&gt;</code>
					</p>
					<h3>Frequently Used Fragments</h3>
					<p>There are some patterns that appear in many places throughout the archive. There are diagrams of these recurring patterns available in our <a href="patterns/index.html">Patterns Index</a>.
					</p>
						<h4>Forms</h4>
						<!-- This should be moved to the Forms section of Patterns if it's not too outdated -->
						<p>Forms, which are styled in 07-interactions.css, should be labeled with fieldsets and legends. Every submit button should be marked up with a <code>&lt;p class="submit"&gt;</code>. On some forms there are cancel buttons, so apply an <code>&lt;input class="cancel"...&gt;</code> and add cancel to that paragraph's classes: <code>&lt;p class="submit cancel"&gt;</code>.
						</p>
						<p>Form controls are inline elements, which means they have to be wrapped in block level elements.
						</p>
							<h5>Definition Lists</h5>
							<p>We generally want forms set up as <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dl.asp" title="HTML dl tag">definition lists</a> (<code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>) because the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dt.asp" title="HTML dt tag">term</a>  (<code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>) and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dd.asp" title="HTML dd tag">defintion</a> (<code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>) structure corresponds nicely to the typical label: [input] structure of a form. We use <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> for the label and <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> for the input, and a <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> can contain more than one <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>. However, since a <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> can only<code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> as top-level elements, the form tag itself cannot come inside the definition list, nor can other elements such as paragraphs or linebreaks. That's okay, though -- we take care of the forms' presentation with CSS.   
							</p>
							<p>Here is the basic template to follow to meet all these rules:</p>
							<h5>Other Form Structures</h5>
							<p>Some forms cannot be logically structured as terms and definitions. As a last resort, these can be structured as paragraphs and can include linebreaks.
							</p>
					<h3>XHTML Identifiers</h3>
					<p>Identifiers are attributes that add meaning to an XHTML element by providing more information about the element's function. Identifiers come in two varieties, <code>class</code> and <code>id</code>. An element can have one, both, or neither type of identifier.</p>
						<h4>Ids</h4>
						<p>The <code>id</code> identifier assigns a name to an element. The name can only be used once per document, and each element can only have one <code>id</code>.
						</p>
						<p>Stylesheets, scripts, and user agents can referece an elements by its <code>id</code>. An <code>id</code> can also serve as an anchor in a hyperlink or as a name for a declared <code>object</code> element.</p>
						<h4>Classes</h4>
						<p>A <code>class</code> identifier assigns a name to an element, but <code>class</code> names can be used multiple times per document and any element can have multiple <code>class</code> names, with each name separated by a single space: <code>&lt;div class="preface group"&gt;This div has the names group and preface.&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
						</p>
						<h4>Our Identifier Naming Conventions</h4>
						<p>Class names should be short, lowercase English (U.S.) words in common usage. They should describe the function, not presentation, of the element to which they are applied. There is more information available in the <a href="classes.html">Classes document</a>.
						</p>
							<h5>Banned Words</h5>
							<p>Anything used in an <code>id</code> or <code>class</code>.
							</p>

				<h2>CSS Specifications</h2>
				<p>We use aproximately 30 external stylesheets written primarily to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/">CSS 2.1 Specifications</a>, although we do permit the use of CSS3 to provide non-essential formatting frills, such as box shadows, text shadows, and gradients.
				</p>
				<p>Before submitting any code, it is always a good idea to check your CSS with <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">the W3C CSS validation service</a>.</p>
					<h3>Our CSS Formatting Conventions</h3>
					<p>Since our stylesheets are edited by multiple coders, we have developed a house style that will allow us to easily read, track changes to, and avoid mistakes in our markup.
					</p>
					<p>A declaration block written for the archive should be formatted with:
						<ul>
							<li>Muliple selectors on the same line, separated by a comma and a single space</li>
							<li>The opening curly brace on the same line as the selector, separated by a single space</li>
							<li>Each property indented and on a new line</li>
								<ul>
									<li>CSS 2.1 properties indented by two spaces</li>
									<li>CSS3 properties listed last and indented by four spaces</li>
								</ul>
							<li>A space between the colon and the property value</li>
							<li>A semi-colon at the end of each property, including the last</li>
							<li>The closing curly brace on a new line, not indented</li>
							<li>A single blank line between declaration blocks</li>
							<li>A zero preceding any decimal value that is less than 1 (e.g. <code>0.643em</code>)</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Here is an example:
						<blockquote><code>#header ul.primary {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;float: none;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: auto;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;background: #900 url(/images/skins/textures/tiles/red-ao3.png);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-bottom: 2px solid #700;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0.25em 120px;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box-shadow: inset 0 -5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);<br />
}<br />
<br />
#header .primary a, #header .primary .current, #header .primary input, #header .search input {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-color: #a00;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-bottom-color: #400;<br />
}</code></blockquote>
