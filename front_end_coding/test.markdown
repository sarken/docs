# Hello, World

This is in the front_end_guide directory. I have no idea if it will still work.

## Code

We want to use pygments because it's awesome. How do we do pygments? I don't know. I might need to generate some CSS.

### GitHub Markdown

Maybe it's the GFM way.

```css
body {
  background: yellow;
}
```

### Liquid

Maybe it's not.

{% highlight css %}
body {
  background: yellow;
}
{% endhighlight %}
