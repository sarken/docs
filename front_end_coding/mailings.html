				<h1>Emails we send</h1>
				<h2>Rationalising our emails</h2>
				<p>Currently we have no style guide for the emails we send from the archive. These emails are important! The way we present them can change the way users experience the archive.</p>
				<p>I suggest (as always) a rationalisation of mailings: a simple
				html template, minimal styling (colour branding), and a short style guide section to go in the <a href="">Archive Style Guide</a> I have begun developing:</p>

				<h4>Emails Style Guide</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>Mail notification views are in [view folder]</li>
				<li>Mail notifications are written in HTML 4.01 and follow this template:<br />
					<code>[brief <a href="">html template</a></code>]</li>
				<li>We do/do not include images. (decide)</li>
				<li>When we include text that is normally parsed on the archive, we return the
				parsed/unparsed content. (decide)</li>
				<li>We use simple friendly language, like this:<br />
					<cite>[example]</cite></li>
				<li>When we reference an action, we always include the right
				link:<br />
				<cite><a href="../">Reply to comment</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Note</h3>
				<p>Email styles have to be kept simple. There should be no positional layout whatsoever, as the only way to achieve this is with tables. I suggest using html 4 and only styling headings. Semantic HTML 4.01 should be employed. This is a small simple project, but requires input from ADT, Docs, and possibly Abuse/Admins.</p>
