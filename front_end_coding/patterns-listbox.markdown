---

A listbox is a box containing a list. We use listbox to show more than one index on a page. Listboxes can be list items and they can nest, but they don't have to. They can be expandable, draggable, and sortable. You can have a single listbox on a page so long as that page could show multiple indexes with enough user data; they don't need to be logicked out in the view file. For example, the [Yuletide Recs collection](http://archiveofourown.org/collections/yuletide_recs) is a collection that only contains bookmarks, but the bookmark index on the collection index is still a listbox. This is allowed because, if someone added a work to the collection, there would also be a work index on that page.

Listbox styles are declared in [11-group-listbox.css](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/blob/master/public/stylesheets/site/2.0/11-group-listbox.css). Listbox is part of the group [supertype](supertype).

### Rules

A listbox can be any block container that can contain these blocks: `h1â€”6`, `p`, `div`, `ul`, `ol`, `dl`. So this means a listbox could be a:

* `fieldset.listbox`
* `div.listbox`
* `li.listbox`
* `dd.listbox`
* `td.listbox` (not recommended)
* `form.listbox` (not recommended)

You can never have an inline listbox of any kind. You can never have a listbox with restricted children: no `table.listbox`, `ol.listbox`, `ul.listbox`, or `dl.listbox`.

The first element inside a listbox is always a heading, and it always contains an index (i.e. `<ol class="index group">`, `<ul class="index group">`, or `<dl class="index group">`). It might also contain a note (e.g. `<p class="note">`) or actions (e.g. `<p class="actions">`) outside the index.

### XHTML diagram

The following diagram is taken from [an index of fandoms for a specific media type](http://archiveofourown.org/media/Theater/fandoms). It's an example of multiple listboxes within an index.

<ol class="diagram">
<li>&lt;ol class="alphabet fandom index group"&gt;
<ol>
<li>&lt;li class="letter listbox group"&gt;
<ol>
<li>&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;
<ol>
<li>&lt;span class="action top"> <span>&lt;a&gt;</span></li>
</ol></li>
<li>&lt;ul class="tags index group"&gt;</li>
</ol></li>
<li>&lt;li class="letter listbox group"&gt;
<ol>
<li>&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;
<ol>
<li>&lt;span class="action top"> <span>&lt;a&gt;</span></li>
</ol></li>
<li>&lt;ul class="tags index group"&gt;</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

### Notes

We call it listbox (instead of indexbox) because a listbox might be a dynamically inserted form or form component, and therefore would need managed focus. This seems most closely related to [the ARIA role listbox](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#listbox).

There are currently no listboxes in the codebase with the role listbox.
