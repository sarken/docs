        <h2 id="web_developer_toolbar">Web Developer Toolbar</h2>
        
        <p>One of the most invaluable tools you can have for working on HTML/CSS in general is 
        a browser plugin that lets you examine and edit the CSS of any web page "live" -- that is,
        rather than having to edit source code, save a file, and refresh the archive page every 
        time you want to test some new change to CSS, you can just edit the CSS within your
        browser until you have it looking the way you want.</p>
        
        <p>We recommend the <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/">Web Developer Toolbar</a>,
          which runs in Firefox or Chrome (on any operating system where one of those browsers runs). 
        </p>
        
        <p>Once you have installed the toolbar, you will be able to edit the CSS of any page you 
          are on with the Edit CSS option:
          
          <img src="images/web_developer_toolbar-edit.png" alt="The Edit CSS menu option highlighted" />
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This will open a window where you can edit any of the archive stylesheets live
          and see the results immediately:
          
          <img src="images/web_developer_toolbar-open.png" alt="The Edit CSS window opened" />
        </p>
